# AirTrojan
**Abstract**: Federated Learning (FL) is a widely adopted
distributed machine learning technique where clients collab-
oratively train a model without sharing their data. A critical
component of FL is client selection, which involves choosing the
necessary number of clients for each training round. Current
client selection algorithms for wireless FL rely on the conditions
of wireless channels but do not account for vulnerabilities from
attacks on these channels, such as channel state information
(CSI) forgery attacks. In this paper, we introduce AirTrojan,
a novel attack vector that targets client selection in FL. Our
key insight is that since the channel state can be manipulated
by attackers, an attacker can adjust their probability of being
chosen as a participant. AirTrojan enhances the feasibility of
adversarial attacks on FL, which usually assume that malicious
clients are always selected as participants. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of AirTrojan by showing how it can disrupt client
selection and facilitate model poisoning attacks on FL. Our
work highlights that it is urgent to add security components to
client selection processes in wireless FL.
